      <p>
        "Once in a farm, where a duck sits on a clutch of eggs to make them
        hatch. The eggs hatch one by one, and soon, there are six
        yellow-feathered ducklings, chirping excitedly. The last egg takes
        longer to hatch, and from it emerges a strange looking duckling with
        grey feathers. Everybody finds the grey duckling ugly, including its own
        mother. The dejected duckling runs away and lives alone in a swamp until
        winter comes. Seeing the duckling starving in winter, a farmer takes
        pity on the ugly duckling and gives it food and shelter at home.
        However, the duckling is afraid of the farmerâ€™s noisy children and flees
        to a cave by a frozen lake. When spring comes, a flock of beautiful
        swans descend on the lake, and the duckling, which is now fully grown,
        but lonely, approaches the swans, fully expecting to be rejected. To his
        surprise, the swans welcome him. He looks at his reflection in the water
        and realises that he is not an ugly duckling anymore, but a beautiful
        swan. The swan joins this flock and flies off with his new family."
